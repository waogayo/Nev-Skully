Add your feedback here ok!

a few things first off about the platforming/movement :3
- changing direction midair messes up your momentum or something in a weird way that i can't describe but it felt bad and kept making me miss my jumpy at da light part???
-fire attack thing only works in 1 direction and in the first room
-figuring out how to do the walljump at the start took a super super long time, i kept jumping upwards and falling for like 2 minutes because i didn't know the timing to redirect
the jump to the other wall? it was just very confusing
-most 2d platformers have a thing where there's a grace period called "coyote time" where after you walk off a platform to jump you're still able to jump even if you're midair
instead of just falling down and it feels a lot better
-if you go left outside and miss the jump it fucking softlocks you and i didn't know it was impassible so i kept going back
-loading didn't work but that might just be my emulator
-that light thing was creative but the timing with the light was really strict for the start of the game and took me a while :(
-
idk how much of the art you did but especially after you get outside i really like it :3
the writing is super cute and charming :3
